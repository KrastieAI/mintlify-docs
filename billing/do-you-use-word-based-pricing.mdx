title: "Do you use word based pricing?"
---

Unlike many competitors, Krastie AI does not implement word-based pricing. Each AI request is counted only once towards your usage, regardless of the model used. While this approach is not without its limitations, as all models contribute equally to your usage, we strive to maintain a pricing structure that is as transparent and straightforward as possible.
